         <h1>The Game of Life</h1>
         <p>This page/game came from the enjoyable and enlightening Udemy class - <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/build-the-game-of-life/">Build the Game of Life</a>. I've since extended the code to make it more user friendly.</p> 
         <p>The Game of Life is a simulation of "Life". It's a basic simulation of life and death; highlighting the effects of isolation and over-population. You can read more about the origions of the game and the rules behind the simulation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules">here.</a></p>
